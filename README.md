# Predictive Analytics for housing-related complaints
Problem Statement:
The New York residents utilize the 311 (the 3-1-1 phone number) system to report complaints about non-emergency problems to local city authorities. 
The systems assign the problems to various agencies in New York. The Housing-related problems are assigned to The Department of Housing Preservation and Development
of New York City. 311 complaints that are related to housing and buildings. The main objective of this project was to develop a machine learning model to predict the possibility of complaints of a particular type. I came up with the solution model by following a step-by-step process. I came up with subproblem statements to simplify tracking my progress over the project. Following are subproblem statements.  
Question 1) Which type of complaint should the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City focus on first?
Question 2) Should the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City focus on any particular set of boroughs, ZIP codes, or streets (where the complaints are severe) for the specific type of complaints you identified in response to question 1?
Question 3) Does the Complaint Type that you identified in response to question 1 have an obvious relationship with any particular characteristic or characteristics of the houses or buildings?
Question 4) Can a predictive model be built for a future prediction of the possibility of complaints of the type that you have identified in response to question 1?
