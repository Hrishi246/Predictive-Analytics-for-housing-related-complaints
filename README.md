of New York City. 311 complaints that are related to housing and buildings.
The agency needs answers to several questions. The answers to those questions must be supported by data and analytics. These are their questions:
Question 1) Which type of complaint should the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City focus on first?
Question 2) Should the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City focus on any particular set of boroughs, ZIP codes, or street (where the complaints are severe) for the specific type of complaints you identified in response to question 1?
Question 3) Does the Complaint Type that you identified in response to question 1 have an obvious relationship with any particular characteristic or characteristics of the houses or buildings?
Question 4) Can a predictive model be built for a future prediction of the possibility of complaints of the type that you have identified in response to question 1?
